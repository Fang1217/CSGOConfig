MAKE SURE TO BACKUP ALL RELEVANT FILES THAT YOU DELETE, CHANGE OR MODIFY IN YOUR GAME FOLDER.
YOU CAN ALSO VERIFY FILES IF YOU'RE AN IDIOT THAT FORGOT TO DO THE STEP ABOVE.

Delete the file "Stratum2.uifont" in "steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\panorama\fonts". (KEEP ALL THE OTHER .ttf FONTS, THE YT VIDEO IS OUTDATED, see Q&A)
Download and add your own .ttf font into that folder (you may need to double-click and install it too).
Place "fonts.conf" into that folder (replace it).
Open the newly (re)placed "fonts.conf" file in Notepad and replace "FONTFILENAME" and "FONTNAME" with the appropriate font names (see attached PNG image for help).
Remember to save your edits of "fonts.conf".

Now go to "steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\core\panorama\fonts\conf.d"
Place "42-repl-global.conf" into that folder (replace it).
Open the newly (re)placed "42-repl-global.conf" file in Notepad and replace "FONTNAME" with the appropriate name.
Remember to save your edits of "42-repl-global.conf".

You should now be all set! Launch the game and admire your new font.

Q&A 
Question: OMG THE NEW CS UPDATE PATCHED THIS, V2 WHEN??
Answer: 9 times out of 10 the CS update hasn't broken it. You probably just need to redo the install process again. Or it's because you did the old method of deleting all .ttf files.

Question: I accidently deleted all the .ttf files in "steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\panorama\fonts". HELP!
Answer: You can download all the old .ttf files here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/qgx5a57yqxj0wb1/Default-ttf-Fonts.rar/file 
For some reason, a CS update changed it so newer installations need to keep these files while people who did the method before don't need them. 
Which made it an absolute pain to troubleshoot ;-;

Question: Where do I find a custom font to use?
Answer: https://www.dafont.com is a good site for finding fonts.

Question: How do I find my Counter-Strike folder?
Answer: In your Steam Library, right-click "Counter-Strike 2", left-click Properties, then "Installed Files", then "Browse...". This is your CS folder.
Now just follow the paths mentioned in the guide.

Question: My font is too large/small? How do I change the size?
Answer: Open "font.conf" in your game folder, scroll down past "<!-- Custom fonts -->" and 
now adjust the values under "pixelsize" to your liking for each font (start with 0.9 to shrink, or 1.1 to enlarge)

Question: (Literally any other question you could ask)?
Answer: I've got no idea, but you're probably alright, 42, or just Google it.

On an added note, if you're a content creator I would prefer that you don't just yoink my guide for your own benefit.
Simply send your audience to the video if they ask. It goes over the whole process with only one part being slightly outdated after 6 months (so not bad!).
Though if you think my whole guide has become outdated and needs a complete redo, just leave a comment. I'll do it if the push is big enough.
Have a wonderful day.
